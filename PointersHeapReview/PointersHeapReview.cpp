    "This implies we can't have a lot of data. So if we need more memory we need to go somewhere else, like the heap. " <<
    "How big is heap? Usually about as big as our addressable space can be. Which is either the logical addressable space or the physical amount of RAM " <<
    "plus any spillover to hard drive if necessary. So gigabytes in size. So how do we access the heap, or stick a variable on the heap? " <<
    "We use the 'new' keyword. The 'new' keyword querries Windows and says 'please give me a spot in heap'. Windows will say, 'I need more " <<
    "information, I can't just give you a spot you have to tell me how much'. So the compiler says, 'OK, please give me 100 ints or int[100]'. " <<
    "Windows says that it doesn't know what 100 ints is, but the compiler does. 4 bytes is an int. So 4x100, the compiler says I need 400 bytes. " <<
    "Windows says that it can do that. And then Windows goes into heap, alocates 400 bytes, and then Windows reutrns the address to the very first element. " <<
